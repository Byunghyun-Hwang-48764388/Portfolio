📌 Project Overview
- Investigated corporate governance structures by analyzing the social network of board members using Graph Theory. This project quantifies the influence of key individuals and the density of organizational relationships to infer decision-making dynamics.

🛠️ Tech Stack
- Analysis: Python (NetworkX, Pandas)
- Visualization: Matplotlib, NetworkX

📊 Key Insights & Results
- Power Structure Analysis: Utilized Betweenness Centrality to identify "information brokers" who connect disparate corporate groups.
- Influence Mapping: Mapped high-impact nodes using Degree Centrality to visualize the most connected figures in the boardroom.
- Organizational Density: Evaluated clustering coefficients to assess the risk of information silos versus integrated communication networks.

🖥️ Presentation
- Analysis Summary: A detailed summary of the findings, including centrality interpretations and network visualizations, is available in the PDF document within this folder.
