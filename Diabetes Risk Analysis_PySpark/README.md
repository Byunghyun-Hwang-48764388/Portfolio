📌 Project Overview
- Built a production-level data pipeline on Databricks using PySpark to analyze diabetes risks. This project demonstrates a full-cycle data solution: from implementing a scalable Medallion Architecture to performing Ad-hoc exploratory analysis to derive actionable clinical insights.

🛠️ Tech Stack
- Engine: Apache Spark (PySpark)
- Environment: Databricks
- Architecture: Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold Layers)
- Analysis Tools: PySpark SQL, Spark DataFrames

🏗️ Data Engineering & Analysis Milestones
- Medallion Pipeline:
- * Bronze/Silver: Automated ingestion and rigorous data cleaning (handling missing values, schema enforcement).
- Gold: Optimized feature-engineered tables for high-performance ML training.
- Ad-hoc Analysis:
  * Conducted targeted queries to uncover deep-dive insights beyond standard modeling.
  Analyzed specific demographic risk factors and correlation patterns between glucose levels, BMI, and age to answer real-world clinical questions.
- ML Modeling: Built scalable classification models to provide high-accuracy risk assessments.
