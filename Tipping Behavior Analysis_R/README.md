📌 Project Overview
- Conducted a comprehensive statistical study on consumer tipping behavior to identify the key drivers of gratuity amounts. This project demonstrates advanced data storytelling and regression analysis using R to provide actionable insights for the hospitality industry.

🛠️ Tech Stack
- Language: R (Quarto/Rmd)
- Key Libraries: ggplot2, dplyr, stats

📊 Key Analysis & Insights
- Regression Modeling: Built a linear model to quantify the impact of total bill size, party size, and day of the week on tip percentages.
- Hypothesis Testing: Performed statistical tests to verify if demographic factors (e.g., gender, smoker status) significantly influence tipping patterns.
- Advanced Visualization: Created multi-faceted scatter plots and box plots to visualize non-linear relationships and outlier behaviors.
