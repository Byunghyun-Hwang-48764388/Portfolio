📌 Project Overview
Developed a machine learning model to predict heart attack risks based on patient health data. This project focuses on rigorous statistical validation and feature analysis to identify key clinical risk factors.

🛠️ Tech Stack
- Languages: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Scipy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

📊 Key Actions & Analysis
- Statistical Validation: Performed Shapiro-Wilk and Mann-Whitney U tests to ensure data integrity and choose appropriate modeling techniques.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized correlations between clinical features (e.g., chest pain type, max heart rate) and heart attack occurrence.
- Predictive Modeling: Implemented classification models to achieve robust prediction performance.

🖥️ Presentation & Results
- Full Report: Detailed analysis steps and visualizations are included in the separate presentation file. Please refer to the PPT file in this directory for comprehensive results.
- Insight: Identified specific physiological thresholds that significantly correlate with increased cardiac risk.
