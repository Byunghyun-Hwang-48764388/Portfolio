📌 Project Overview
Developed a machine learning model to predict heart attack risks. Focused on rigorous statistical validation and medical feature analysis to identify key patient risk factors.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python: Scikit-learn, Scipy, Pandas, Seaborn

📊 Key Analysis
Statistical Rigor: Verified data distribution using Shapiro-Wilk and Mann-Whitney U tests for clinical validity.

EDA: Visualized correlations between physiological metrics (e.g., heart rate, chest pain) and cardiac risk.

Modeling: Built high-precision classifiers to identify high-risk patients.
